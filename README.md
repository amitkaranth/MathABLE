Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects 
communication and social interaction. Children with autism often have difficulty 
expressing themselves, understanding social cues, and engaging in social interaction, 
which can significantly impact their ability to form relationships and communicate 
effectively with others.

The mobile applications for autistic children also provide parents and caregivers 
with valuable resources and support, empowering them to better understand and 
support their child's unique needs. These applications have the potential to 
revolutionize the way we approach autism therapy and support, providing a 
personalized and accessible tool for children with autism to thrive and reach their 
full potential
